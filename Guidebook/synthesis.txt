DOMAIN 15 — PLANTING CALENDAR SYNTHESIS UI
Purpose

Transform all knowledge about plants, seasonality, growth stages, and climate into a dynamic, personalized calendar for the user.
UI shows what to plant, when, and why, based on verified rules.

15.1 Calendar Synthesis Principles

Use climate zone + current date + plant lifecycle

Filter by sowing window and harvest window

Apply conflict resolution rules (e.g., frost risk)

Display confidence & explanation for each recommendation

Include planting method & companion suggestions

15.2 JSON — Calendar Event Entity
{
  "calendar_event": [
    {
      "event_id": "calendar_001",
      "plant_id": "plant_tomato",
      "action": "sow",
      "recommended_dates": {
        "start": "2026-04-15",
        "end": "2026-05-15"
      },
      "growth_stage": "stage_germination",
      "location_context": {
        "climate_zone_id": "climate_zone_usda_6b",
        "sunlight": "sun_full",
        "soil_type": "soil_loamy"
      },
      "confidence_score": 0.97,
      "explanation_payload_id": "explanation_789",
      "companion_plants": ["plant_basil", "plant_marigold"],
      "planting_method": "direct_sow_or_transplant"
    }
  ]
}

15.3 UI Display Contracts
{
  "calendar_ui_contract": [
    {
      "view_type": "month_overview",
      "fields": ["plant_name", "action", "recommended_dates", "confidence_score"],
      "tooltip_fields": ["explanation_summary", "companion_plants", "planting_method"]
    },
    {
      "view_type": "detailed_day",
      "fields": ["plant_name", "action", "growth_stage", "confidence_score", "sources"],
      "tooltip_fields": ["detailed_explanation", "risk_notes", "alternative_actions"]
    }
  ]
}


This ensures no calendar event is displayed without explanation and user can drill down for provenance.

DOMAIN 16 — DIAGNOSTICS CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS
Purpose

Every diagnosis or recommendation from pests, diseases, or growth problems is annotated with confidence.
UI and rules enforce thresholds for action.

16.1 Confidence Threshold Principles

Actionable: confidence ≥ 0.7 → allow recommendation

Warning: 0.4 ≤ confidence < 0.7 → show advisory

Informational only: confidence < 0.4 → suggest monitoring, no action

Each threshold is source- and context-aware:

frost, soil, pest history, microclimate

Rules producing low-confidence hypotheses cannot override high-confidence rules

16.2 JSON — Diagnostics Confidence Entity
{
  "diagnostic_confidence_thresholds": [
    {
      "threshold_id": "threshold_high",
      "min_confidence": 0.7,
      "action_level": "actionable",
      "ui_display": "highlighted_green",
      "note": "Safe to act; high evidence"
    },
    {
      "threshold_id": "threshold_medium",
      "min_confidence": 0.4,
      "max_confidence": 0.69,
      "action_level": "warning",
      "ui_display": "yellow_warning",
      "note": "Monitor and consider corrective actions"
    },
    {
      "threshold_id": "threshold_low",
      "max_confidence": 0.39,
      "action_level": "informational",
      "ui_display": "blue_info",
      "note": "Track only; insufficient evidence for action"
    }
  ]
}

    }
  ]
}

16.4 UI Integration Contract

High confidence: actionable button enabled

Medium confidence: advisory pop-up with explanation

Low confidence: informational only; monitoring checkbox

All explanations come from the payload, never generated on the fly.
