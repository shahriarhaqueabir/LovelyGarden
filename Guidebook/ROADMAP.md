# Project Garden Deck Roadmap

This is the simplified, sequential roadmap for executing Project Garden Deck from start to finish.

## ✅ Phase 1: Knowledge & Foundations (COMPLETED)

1. **Schema Lockdown**: 16 domain models established in `knowledge-graph.ts`.
2. **Local-First Core**: React + RxDB + IndexedDB pipeline initialized.
3. **PWA Integration**: Service worker and manifests for offline installability.

## ✅ Phase 2: Logic & Simulation (COMPLETED)

1. **Lifecycle FSM**: XState-driven growth stages logic.
2. **Temporal Engine**: Global Day advancement and temporal state persistence.
3. **Reasoning Subsystem**: Companion scores and seasonal sowing calculation.

## ✅ Phase 3: Organization & UX (COMPLETED)

1. **Grid Dynamics**: Interactive slots, drag-and-drop planting, and garden expansion.
2. **Encyclopedia Search**: Filterable views for the plant catalog.
3. **Location Aware**: Hemisphere-specific calendars and localized (Dresden) assumptions.

## 🔜 Phase 4: Command Center (IN PROGRESS)

1. **Environmental HUD**: High-density metrics bar in Header.
2. **Real-Time Synergy**: Visualizing NPK and companion bonuses in real-time.
3. **Time Scrubbing**: Implementation of the year-long temporal slider.

## 📅 Phase 5: Horticultural Depth (PLANNED)

1. **Ritual Loop**: Water/Fertilize mechanics and nutrient depletion.
2. **Dynamic Weather**: Integration with real-world forecast APIs.
3. **Advanced Simulation**: Pest/Disease contagion and diagnostic clinical view.
