# Project Garden Deck Roadmap

This is the simplified, sequential roadmap for executing Project Garden Deck from start to finish.

## ✅ Phase 1: Knowledge & Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
1.  **Define Domain Schemas**: Established 16 normalized schemas (Time, Species, Climate, etc.).
2.  **Setup Core Tech Stack**: Initialized React/Vite/TypeScript/RxDB.
3.  **Knowledge Assembly**: Aggregated `seeds.json` and `sources.json`.
4.  **Data Hydration**: Built RxDB injection utility for first load.

## ✅ Phase 2: The Logic Engine (COMPLETED)
1.  **Build Lifecycle FSM**: Implemented XState growth machine.
2.  **Develop Reasoning Rules**: Coded companion, seasonal, and confidence logic.
3.  **Create Explainability Payloads**: Standardized reasoning output for UI transparency.

## ✅ Phase 4: The Garden Interface (COMPLETED)
1.  **Design Garden Grid**: Built 2D CSS Grid and Inventory Tray.
2.  **Implement Drag-and-Drop**: Wired `dnd-kit` for planting mechanics.
3.  **Reactive Binding**: Connected RxDB observers via custom hooks.

## ✅ Phase 4: Governance & Advanced Features (COMPLETED)
1.  **Implement Diagnostic View**: Created the Plant Inspector with source citations.
2.  **Build the Store**: Implemented the Seed Vault for inventory management.
3.  **Dynamic Calendar**: Coded hemisphere-aware seasonal recommendations.

## ✅ Phase 5: Reliability & Deployment (COMPLETED)
1.  **PWA Integration**: Configured offline manifests and service workers via Vite PWA.
2.  **Documentation**: Created comprehensive Technical Spec, User Guide, and Data Governance docs.
3.  **Final Build**: Verified production build stability via `npm run build`.
