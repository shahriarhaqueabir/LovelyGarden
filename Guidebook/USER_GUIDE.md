# User Guide: Mastering the Garden Deck

Welcome to **Garden Deck**, your personal horticultural grimoire. This guide will help you transform your empty grid into a thriving garden.

## 1. The Dashboard

Your screen is divided into three main zones:
1. **The Garden Grid**: Your 2D field of possibility. This is where you plant and manage your crops.
2. **The Hand (Inventory)**: Your current collection of seed packets.
3. **The Seed Vault**: Access this via the **(+)** button in your Hand to acquire new species.

## 2. Planting Your First Crop

1. **Select a Seed**: Look at your Hand at the bottom of the screen.
2. **Drag and Drop**: Pick up a seed packet (like "Beefsteak Tomato") and drag it onto an empty slot in the Garden Grid.
3. **Verify**: The seed will appear in its "Germination" stage.

## 3. The Plant Inspector

Want to know more about a specific plant in your garden?
1. **Click on any plant** in the grid.
2. A side-panel will open (the **Inspector**).
3. Here you can see:
   - **Growth Progress**: A bar showing how close the plant is to the next stage.
   - **Health & Harmony**: Real-time stats on how well the plant is doing and if its neighbors are helping it grow (Companion Planting).
   - **Horticultural Integrity**: Proof of where our data comes from.

## 4. Seasonal Awareness

The Garden Deck is smart. It knows what time of year it is.
- **Set Your Location**: Click the **Settings (Gear)** icon at the top right to set your Hemisphere.
- **Check Recommendations**: In the Plant Inspector, we'll tell you if it's the right time to sow that specific plant based on your location.

## 5. Offline Access

Since Garden Deck is a **Local-First** app, you can use it anywhere—even in remote garden patches without Wi-Fi.
- On most browsers, you can "Install" the app or "Add to Home Screen" to use it just like a regular mobile app.

*Happy Gardening! May your harvest be plentiful.*
