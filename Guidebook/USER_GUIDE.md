# User Guide: Mastering the Garden Deck

Welcome to **Garden Deck**, your personal horticultural grimoire. This guide will help you transform your empty grid into a thriving garden.

## 1. The Command Center Dashboard

Your gardening interface is now a high-density tactical display:

1. **Environment HUD (Header)**: Monitor real-time (and simulated) atmospheric data:
   - **Sun Intensity**: Based on time-of-day and seasonal position.
   - **Moisture Level**: Current humidity and soil saturation.
   - **Temperature**: Realized temperature for Dresden (or your set location).
2. **The Garden Grid**: Your 2D field. Use the **Layer Toggles** to switch between:
   - **Hydration View**: See which plants are thirsty.
   - **Health View**: Monitor stress levels and wilting.
   - **Nutrient (NPK) View**: Check soil fertility levels.
3. **The Hand (Inventory)**: Seed packets available for planting.
4. **The Seed Vault**: Access 52+ species via the **(+)** button.

## 2. Planting & Multi-Layer Management

1. **Select a Seed**: Drag a packet from your Hand onto an empty slot.
2. **Synergy Indicators**: Look for the **Glow Effect** — this indicates a companion planting bonus (+10% growth).
3. **Temporal Scrubber**: (Upcoming) Use the slider to advance the simulation by days or weeks to predict growth patterns.

## 3. The Botanical Inspector

Click any plant to open the **Inspector Pane**:

- **Real-time Lifecycle**: Track progress through stages (Seedling → Vegetative → Harvest).
- **Synergy Breakdown**: See exactly which neighbors are helping or hindering.
- **Ritual Actions**: (Upcoming) Use the "Water" or "Fertilize" buttons to manually intervene in the plant's health.
- **Horticultural Integrity**: Review the scientific sources (RHS, UC Davis) for every botanical fact.

## 4. Seasonal Simulation

The Garden Deck is synchronized with the **Global Clock**:

- **Location Settings**: Set your Hemisphere and City in the **Settings Gear**.
- **Seasonal Warnings**: A "Risky Timing" badge appears on seeds that are out-of-window for your current simulation day.

## 5. Offline Grimoire

Garden Deck is a **Local-First** application. All data is saved on your device. You can "Install" it as a PWA on your home screen for true offline management.
