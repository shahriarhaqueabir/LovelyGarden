🛠️ Part 1: The Technical "Action Map"

This map defines the logic used by the Simulation Agent to determine the state of the garden.

1. The Environmental Risk Engine

Input Data: GPS Coordinates $\rightarrow$ DWD Weather API (7-day forecast) $\rightarrow$ Historical Frost Data.

Logic:

Compare $T_{min}$ (Forecast) against $T_{lethal}$ (Plant Species Metadata).

If $T_{min} < (T_{lethal} + 2^{\circ}C)$, trigger Stressor Event: Cold Stress.

If $T_{min} < 0^{\circ}C$ and $Stage = Seedling$, set $Status = Critical$.

Action: Generate a "Remedy" task: “Install Fleece Cover immediately.”

2. The Growth & Temporal Projection Engine

Input Data: Current Day + Plant Age + Accumulated Growing Degree Days (GDD).

Logic:

$$GDD = \frac{T_{max} + T_{min}}{2} - T_{base}$$

The agent calculates if the plant has enough heat to move to the next stage.

Action: If $GDD_{total} \ge Threshold_{stage}$, update $Stage$ (e.g., Sprout $\to$ Vegetative).

3. The Companion Synergy Calculator

Input Data: Grid Coordinates $[x,y]$ of all active plants.

Logic:

Scan Moore Neighborhood (8 adjacent cells).

Check companionship.json for ID matches.

Apply Multipliers:

Companion Match: +15% Disease Resistance, +10% Growth Speed.

Antagonist Match: -20% Yield, +30% Pest Attraction.

Action: Update the "Synergy Aura" in the GUI.

🎨 Part 2: GUI Design Specifications

The GUI must be Sunlight-Readable (high contrast) and Tactile (large touch targets for outdoor use).

1. Color Palette & Typography

Surface: #F8F9FA (Neutral light for outdoors) or #0C0A09 (OLED high-contrast dark).

Status Colors:

Health: #2ECC71 (Vibrant Green)

Urgent Care: #E67E22 (International Orange)

Lethal/Dead: #95A5A6 (Muted Gray)

Typography: Sans-serif (Inter or Roboto), minimum 12pt for data, 18pt for headers.

2. The "Seed Vault" & "Pocket" UI

Visual Metaphor: The Vault looks like a multi-tabbed file folder. The "Pocket" is a floating dock at the bottom of the screen.

Animation: Dragging a card from the Vault to the Pocket uses a "spring" physics animation. The card "scales down" to fit the pocket.

3. The Grid Interface (Tactical Map)

Component: GridSlot

Visual Layers:

Default: Shows the plant icon and a health ring.

X-Ray Toggle: Replaces icons with N-P-K bars and soil moisture percentages.

Synergy Toggle: Draws glowing lines between companion plants.

4. The Time Travel "Scrubber"

UI Element: A horizontal slider at the bottom, just above the Pocket.

Visual Feedback: As the user scrubs forward, a "ghost" of the plant's future size appears. The background sky color shifts to reflect the predicted weather (e.g., turning gray if rain is forecasted on "Day 15").

5. Sowing Calendar Component

Structure: A horizontal scrolling list of months.

Visual Bar:

---- (Dashed): Ideal for indoor sowing.

==== (Solid): Ideal for outdoor planting.

!!!! (Red Highlight): High frost risk period (Dresden specific: May 11–15).


To implement the Garden Deck: Dresden Pro using an AI-agent architecture, we must define each component as a discrete "Service" or "Agent Module." This ensures the system can handle the complex logic of biological simulation while maintaining a fluid, gamified UI.

1. The Seed Vault (The "Deep Storage" Module)

The Vault is the master repository of all genetic assets owned by the user.

Logic: It acts as the "Cold Storage" for seed data. It tracks quantities, purchase dates, and expiration (viability) based on species-specific shelf-life.

Agent Role: A Librarian Agent monitors the vault, notifying the user when seeds are getting old or when "Special Varieties" (e.g., Heirloom Harzfeuer Tomatoes) are available for the current season.

UI: A heavy, secure-looking digital binder with sorting filters for "Rarity," "Origin," and "Germination Rate."

2. Seed Inventory (The "Pocket" / Active Hand)

This is the bridge between storage and the field.

Logic: When a user moves a seed from the Vault to the Inventory, it is assigned to the "Active Hand." This triggers the Pre-Planting Agent, which prepares the specific metadata needed for the current location (Dresden).

Workflow: User selects a seed packet $\rightarrow$ "Transfer to Pocket" $\rightarrow$ The seed card now floats in the Bottom Dock UI, ready for drag-and-drop.

Gamification: The "Pocket" has limited slots (e.g., 8 slots), forcing users to strategize which crops they are focusing on for the current session.

3. Sowing Calendar (The "Temporal Governance" Module)

This is the scientific heart of the app, localized for Zone 7b/8a.

Logic: A dynamic timeline mapped to the ISO 8601 week system. It calculates "Ideal," "Possible," and "Risky" windows based on historical Dresden frost dates (May 15).

Agent Role: The Chronos Agent cross-references the 200+ plant database with current calendar dates to highlight "High-Success" windows.

Visuals: Gantt-style bars showing indoor vs. outdoor sowing.

4. Real-Time Weather Integration (The "Environmental Engine")

Logic: API integration with DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst) or OpenWeather. It pulls temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed for the user's specific GPS coordinates.

Functionality: The data is fed into the Simulation Agent, which calculates "Evapotranspiration" (how much water the plants are losing) and "Frost Risk."

Workflow: If the 3:00 AM forecast shows 1°C, the app sends a push notification: "Frost Alert: Cover your Basil!"

5. Gamification (The "Engagement" Layer)

This transforms a tool into a simulator.

Leveling System: Users gain "Green Thumb XP" for successful harvests, consistent watering, and identifying pests correctly.

Milestones: Unlocking "Advanced Crops" (e.g., difficult-to-grow Orchids or Melons) as the user proves their competence.

Visual Evolution: The garden grid isn't static; as plants thrive, the UI becomes more vibrant. If neglected, the UI desaturates (turns gray/brown).

6. Universal CRUD Operations (The "Omni-Editor")

Create: Add new seeds to the vault via photo/barcode scan.

Read: Deep-dive into plant history and current health stats.

Update: Edit soil types, log fertilizer applications, or change garden layouts.

Delete/Archive: Harvest a plant (move to Log) or delete a failed crop (Compost).

Agent Role: An Observer Agent records every CRUD action into a "Garden Audit Log" for end-of-season review.

7. Time Travel (The "Predictive Scrubber")

This is a high-fidelity projection feature.

Forward Travel: Scrub the timeline forward 14 days to see the "Projected Growth." The AI calculates growth based on the 7-day forecast + historical averages.

Backward Travel: Review the garden as it looked on any previous date.

UI: A "Time Dial" in the HUD. When turned, the grid "ghosts" through stages of germination and maturity.

8. Plant Care, Tips, & Hints (The "Mentor" Agent)

Logic: A contextual help system. If the user clicks a "Struggling" plant, the Mentor Agent provides a "Reasoning Payload."

Features: Pro-tips for "Thinning," "Pruning," and "Hardening Off."

Dresden Specificity: Tips like "In Dresden's sandy soil, add compost now to retain moisture."

9. Companion & Synergy Recommendations (The "Relationship" Engine)

Logic: A relational database mapping every plant to its friends and foes.

Functionality: When a seed is held over a grid slot, the system calculates a Synergy Score.

Visuals: Green/Red connection lines appear between the held seed and already-planted neighbors.

Example: Planting Marigolds next to Tomatoes reduces the "Pest Event" probability by 25%.

10. Master Plant Database (The "Knowledge Graph")

Scale: 200+ detailed profiles (Vegetables, Herbs, Flowers, Shrubs).

Search Engine: Advanced filters for "Drought Tolerant," "Bee Friendly," "Beginner Level," and "Harvest Window."

Data Points: Germination temp, pH preference, N-P-K needs, spacing (cm), and frost sensitivity.

Implementation Workflow for AI Agents:

Agent A (Data Architect): Manages the CRUD and the Seed Vault/Inventory sync via RxDB.

Agent B (The Scientist): Processes Weather + Companion Logic + Calendar dates to determine health.

Agent C (The Visualizer): Updates the Frontend (Time Travel, Gamification HUD) based on Agent B's calculations.
