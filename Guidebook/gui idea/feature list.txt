To maximize the "high-fidelity simulation" feel, we transition the GUI from a simple app to a Command Center. This involves layering deep data visualizations (the "Tool") over a highly interactive, tactile map (the "Game").

1. Visual Navigation & HUD (The Command Center)
The Living Map (Isometric/Grid Toggle): A high-fidelity visual representation of your garden. Plants grow in size and change color based on real-time health data.

Time-Scrubbing Timeline: A slider at the bottom of the screen. Dragging it forward "ghosts" the future state of your garden based on current growth rates and the DWD (German Weather Service) forecast.

Environmental HUD: A persistent top-bar showing:

Lichtstunden: Current daily sunlight hours for Dresden.

Bodenfeuchte: A simulated "Soil Moisture" gauge calculated from the last rain vs. current evaporation.

Frost-Countdown: Days remaining until the Eisheiligen (May 15).

2. Pro-Level Planning Features
Companion Synergy Overlay: When moving a plant card, the grid lights up in Green (Buff) or Red (Debuff).

Example: Hovering a Tomato card near Basil highlights the Basil green (+10% Pest Resistance).

Succession Planting Wizard: The GUI suggests a "Follow-up Crop" for every slot. If your Radishes are 5 days from harvest, the app suggests sowing Spinach in that same space to maximize the 150-day Dresden growing season.

Shadow Mapping: Input your garden’s orientation (e.g., south-facing balcony vs. shaded backyard). The GUI overlays a "Heatmap" showing where the light is strongest throughout the day.

3. Deep Diagnostic & Care Functionalities
The "Horticultural X-Ray": Click any plant to enter "Scan Mode."

Nutrient Radar: Displays a radar chart of N-P-K (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) levels.

Pest Probability Engine: Shows a percentage risk for local threats (e.g., "75% Risk: Slugs after tonight's rain").

Symptom Library (AR-Ready): A visual matching tool. Instead of typing "yellow leaves," the user scrolls through high-res photos of leaf damage (Chlorosis, Necrosis, Blight) specific to Saxon soil.

Intervention Command Bar: Tactical buttons to "Apply Neem Oil," "Add Compost Tea," or "Prune Infected Area," each with a predicted recovery time.

4. Advanced Logging & Automation
The "Garden Timeline" (History): A vertical "social media feed" of your garden's life. It automatically logs "Day 12: First Sprout," "Day 45: Applied Fertilizer," and "Day 60: 4kg Harvest."

Micro-Climate Personalization: Deep settings for Dresden-specific variables:

Soil Texture: Select between Elbe sand, garden loam, or heavy clay.

Water Source: Log if you use tap water (hard water in Dresden) vs. rainwater to track pH shifts.

Harvest Analytics: Charts showing "Yield per Square Meter" and "Resource Efficiency" (Water used vs. Fruit produced).

5. Social & Comparative Workflows (Simulated or Real)
Dresden Neighborhood Benchmarking: (Optional/Simulated) See how your tomato growth compares to the average growth in the Dresden-Neustadt or Striesen areas.

Seed Catalog Integration: A digital "Binder" to store photos of your physical seed packets, automatically pulling the correct metadata (Sowing depth, spacing) from the internal database.


Core Workflows
Workflow A: The Planting Loop
Consult: User opens the Calendar to see what is "Safe to Plant" in Dresden today.

Select: User selects "Tomato - Beefsteak" from the Knowledge Vault.

Validate: The GUI shows a Companion Alert ("Best planted near Basil").

Execute: User taps "Add to Garden." The system sets the Harvest Timer to 85 days.

Workflow B: The Morning Maintenance Loop
Check Weather: User opens the app; the Weather HUD shows a dry 28°C day.

Review Tasks: The Care Planner generates three tasks: "Watering," "Mulching," and "Check for Aphids."

Perform & Log: User performs the tasks and swipes each card to "Complete." The Hydration Bar in the Active Field resets to 100%.

Workflow C: The Diagnostic Loop
Alert: The app sends a notification: "High Humidity Alert: Blight Risk Increased."

Inspect: User opens the Diagnostic Solver and confirms dark spots on leaves.

Remedy: User follows the "Organic Remedy" (Copper spray or pruning) and logs the action.

Monitor: The Health Badge on the plant card changes to "Recovering."


Phased Progress Bars: Each plant entry displays multi-state bars:

Dotted: Indoor sowing window.

Solid: Safe outdoor planting.

Striped: Risky "Hardening off" periods.

"Plant Now" Engine: A one-tap filter that cross-references the current date and Dresden weather to highlight cards in your hand that are currently at peak planting efficiency.

🪴 The "Active Field" Dashboard (My Garden)
Living Grid/List View: Toggle between a spatial map of your garden and a list view optimized for quick scanning of care tasks.

Real-Time Status Badges: * Hydration Level: A depleting blue bar based on evapotranspiration math.

Health: A green-to-red gradient reflecting pest/disease stress.

Time-Passing Simulator: A "Advance Day" toggle (for planning) that predicts how your garden will look in 7 days based on the forecast.

🧬 The Knowledge Vault (Encyclopedia)
Localized Metadata: Profiles for plants specifically vetted for Saxony (Zone 7b/8a).

Companion Logic Visualization: A "Connections" view that draws lines between plants showing symbiotic bonuses (e.g., Nitrogen fixing) or competitive risks.

Growth Phase Gallery: High-res photo sequences of each plant from seed to harvest so users can visually verify if their plant is "on track."


1. Dynamic Planting Calendar (Dresden Edition)
Localized Timeline: A month-by-month interactive schedule (March–October) anchored to Dresden’s historical frost dates (May 15th last frost).

Sowing Toggles: Visual distinction between Vorkultur (indoor sowing) and Direktsaat (outdoor planting).

Current-Window Filter: A "Plant Now" button that instantly filters the database for crops compatible with the current week's weather.

2. Active Garden Dashboard (My Garden)
Live Status Tracking: Cards for every active plant showing "Days since planting" and "Estimated Harvest Window."

Task Management: Quick-action buttons for irrigation and fertilizing, generated from specific plant requirements.

Archive & Success Metrics: One-tap harvesting to move plants into the Historical Log for yield tracking.

3. Plant Encyclopedia & Database
Regional Selection: A curated library of plants optimized for the Elbe Valley (Zone 7b/8a) climate.

Companion Matrix: Visual guide showing beneficial pairings (e.g., Tomato + Basil) and antagonistic neighbors (e.g., Tomato + Potato).

Growth Phase Profiles: Detailed info on germination temperatures, spacing requirements, and sun exposure levels.

4. Smart Diagnostics & Problem Solver
Issue Identification: Step-by-step wizard to identify common Dresden pests (like aphids or slugs) and diseases (like Phytophthora blight).

Actionable Advice: Organic treatment recommendations that prioritize garden health over chemical use.

Risk Heatmap: Alerts triggered by weather patterns (e.g., "High humidity + 20°C: Increase monitoring for fungal growth").
