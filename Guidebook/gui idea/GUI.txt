🏛️ Section 1: The Main Deck (Primary Interface)

The Main Deck is the persistent workspace. It is divided into three primary zones.

Tab A: The Tactical Grid (Center View)

This is the "Game Field" where biological simulation occurs.

Sub-Tab: Visual Layers (HUD)

Growth View: Default mode showing plant icons and stage (Seedling, Mature).

Resource View: Overlays N-P-K (Nutrient) and $H_2O$ (Hydration) status bars.

Synergy View: Draws glowing "Connection Lines" between companion plants (e.g., Green for Buffs, Red for Antagonists).

Sub-Tab: The Time Scrubber

Function: A slider to scrub from Day -30 (History) to Day +90 (Projection).

Visuals: Ghosts the future growth of plants using the GDD (Growing Degree Days) calculation.

Tab B: The Strategy Sidebar (Left)

Sub-Tab: Sowing Calendar

Function: A vertical timeline of the 200+ plants.

Logic: Filters by "Plantable in Dresden Now." Uses solid bars for outdoor and dotted for indoor windows.

Sub-Tab: The Seed Vault

Function: The master CRUD interface for your "Deep Storage."

Action: Click to "Withdraw to Pocket" (moves data to the Bottom Dock).

🎒 Section 2: The Command Dock (Bottom Interface)

This area handles the "Physical" transition of assets into the garden.

Tab A: The Pocket (Active Inventory)

Functionality: A horizontal "Hand" of up to 8 seed cards.

Interaction: Drag-and-drop from Pocket to Grid.

Features: Shows "Compatibility Score" as you hover a card over a specific grid slot.

Tab B: The Tool Kit

Action: Water: Resets the evaporation timer.

Action: Fertilize: Modifies the soil N-P-K metadata for that slot.

Action: Remedy: Opens the Diagnostic Wizard if a plant shows a "Stressor" icon.

🔬 Section 3: The Pro-Inspector (Right Panel)

This panel activates only when a plant or empty slot is selected.

Tab A: Biological Profile

Data: Variety name, scientific name, age, and health percentage.

Care Hints: "Mentor Agent" text bubbles providing tips like "Thin these sprouts to 10cm for optimal yield."

Tab B: Environmental Logic

Weather HUD: Current Dresden temp, humidity, and "Real-Feel" for that specific plant.

Risk Assessment: Shows % probability of frost or pest infestation for the next 48 hours.

🧠 Section 4: Implementation Workflow for AI Agents

To maintain a fluent flow, the GUI is powered by a Tri-Agent System:

AgentModule ResponsibilityGUI Sync TaskAgent: ArchivistSeed Vault & CRUDSyncs the "Vault" UI with the local RxDB database.Agent: BotanistSynergy & Care LogicUpdates "Synergy Lines" and "Health Rings" on the Grid.Agent: MeteorWeather & Time TravelAdjusts the "Time Scrubber" projections based on live DWD data.🎨 Section 5: Design Standards

Dresden Precision: All date formats are DD.MM.YYYY.

Sunlight Legibility: High-contrast backgrounds (#F8F9FA) with bold icon weights.

Gamification Feed: A small "XP" notification floats upward from a slot when a care task (Watering/Fertilizing) is completed.


GUI Component Map

1. The Primary Deck (Main Screen)

This is the persistent base layer. It is designed for "Glanceability"—the user should know the garden's status in under 3 seconds.

HUD (Top Bar): * Weather Segment: Real-time Dresden DWD feed (Temp, Wind, UV).

XP/Level Tracker: Gamification bar showing "Green Thumb" rank.

Global Alerts: Marquee for Frost Warnings or "Peak Planting" windows.

Tactical Garden Field (Center): * Isometric Grid: 2.5D view of plants.

The X-Ray Toggle: Switches icons to data-driven bars (N-P-K levels, Water, Health).

The Temporal Scrubber (Bottom): * Time-Travel Dial: Scrub forward/backward.

*

2. Tab: The Sowing Calendar (Sidebar A)

This is the "Oracle" component. It cross-references the 200+ plant database with the current date.

Filter Sub-Tabs: * "Plant Now": Only shows seeds optimal for the current week in Dresden.

"Indoor Start": Focused on Feb–Mar Vorkultur.

"Direct Sow": Focused on post-May 15th logic.

Visual Indicators:

Solid Bar: Safe outdoor window.

Dotted Bar: Pre-culture/Indoor period.

Pulsing Alert: Indicates a plant is at the end of its sowing window (Use it or lose it).

3. Tab: The Seed Vault & Inventory (Sidebar B)

The CRUD hub for your assets.

Sub-Tab 1: The Vault (Storage): * Comprehensive list of all owned seeds.

Action: "Withdraw" (Moves seed data from Vault to Pocket).

Sub-Tab 2: The Pocket (Hand): * Max 8 slots. These are the seeds physically "on" the user for planting.

Sub-Tab 3: Add/Edit (CRUD): * Form for manual entry or AI-assisted photo-recognition of seed packets.

4. Tab: The Pro-Inspector (Contextual Panel)

This panel slides out from the right when a plant is selected.

Sub-Tab: Diagnostics: * Symptom Matcher: "Identify Issue" button that triggers the AI agent to analyze health data vs. local pathogens.

Sub-Tab: Synergy: * Companion Score: Explains why a plant is thriving/suffering based on neighbors.

*

Sub-Tab: Care Tips: * Dynamic "Hint" cards (e.g., "Dresden is expecting a heatwave; mulch this Tomato today to save water").

To maintain "Universal CRUD" and "Time Travel," the implementation will use a State Machine (XState):

State A (The Seed): Entry in the Vault.

State B (The Pocket): Active inventory item.

State C (The Entity): A planted object on the grid with unique ID, timestamp, and biological "health" variable.

State D (The History): Archived "Harvest" data for the Garden Log.
