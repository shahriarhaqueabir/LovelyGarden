2. Architecture & Tech Stack
Based on "Browser-First," "Offline-First," and "Card Game Mechanics," here is the proposed stack prioritizing reliability and local state management.

Core Philosophy: Local-First
The app behaves like a desktop application. The server is only used for backup or multiplayer features (if any).

Language: TypeScript.

Why: Essential for maintaining strict contracts between the Game Logic, Data Models, and UI. Prevents an entire class of runtime errors.

Runtime/Framework: React (via Vite).

Why: The "Card" metaphor maps 1:1 to React Components. The ecosystem for Drag-and-Drop (planting cards) and virtualized lists (inventory) is mature.

State & Database (The Critical Piece): RxDB (Reactive Database) sitting on top of IndexedDB.

Why: Standard Redux/Context is insufficient for offline persistence. RxDB allows us to treat the local database as the "Store." It supports real-time UI updates when data changes and handles replication to a backend (if added later) seamlessly.

PWA (Progressive Web App): Vite PWA Plugin.

Why: Handles the Service Worker caching strategies required to load the app shell and static assets without an internet connection.

Logic Engine: XState.

Why: Managing plant lifecycles (Seed → Sprout → Veg → Flower → Harvest) is a Finite State Machine. XState visualizes and enforces these logic flows to prevent bugs (e.g., harvesting a plant that hasn't grown).

3. The "Garden Codex": AI Orchestration Plan
This is the Master Design Plan. You will use these definitions to initialize your AI session or sub-agents.

Phase 1: Project definition & Guardrails
Mission: Build "Garden Deck" (working title), a local-first PWA that gamifies gardening through card-based interactions while providing agronomic accuracy. Vision: To make gardening accessible and engaging by visualizing plant biology as game mechanics.

Global Guardrails (For all Agents):

No Internet Assumption: All features must function 100% without a network connection after the initial load.

Mobile Ergonomics: All distinct UI touch targets must be at least 44x44px. Bottom-navigation preferred for one-handed use.

Strict Typing: No any types in TypeScript. All Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) must be defined in shared interfaces.

Optimistic UI: Interactions (planting, watering) happen instantly in the UI; the database persists them asynchronously.

Phase 2: Domain Segmentation & Prompt Scaffolding
Copy and paste these prompts to specific sub-agents to execute the work.

Agent A: System Architect & Data Modeler
Goal: Define the Schema, Relationships, and Offline Storage strategy.

Prompt: You are the Data Architect. We are building an offline-first gardening PWA using RxDB (IndexedDB).

Task: Design the JSON Schema and TypeScript interfaces for the following entities:

PlantLibraryItem: Immutable reference data (Name, N-P-K reqs, Companions, GrowthStages[]).

InventoryCard: A user-owned instance of a seed (connects to PlantLibraryItem, Quantity).

GardenBed: A container representing a physical location.

PlantedEntity: An instance of a card played in a bed. Must track: plantedDate, currentStage, lastWatered, healthStatus.

Requirements:

Define a relationship where PlantedEntity references PlantLibraryItem by ID.

Create a specialized Type for GrowthStage (duration, water needs, graphic asset ID).

Design the schema to support querying "All plants needing water today."

output strictly in TypeScript interfaces and RxDB schema JSON.

Agent B: Game Logic & Agronomy Engine
Goal: Implement the rules of the simulation (Growth, Calendar, Compatibility).

Prompt: You are the Logic Engine Developer. We are using XState and TypeScript.

Task 1 (Lifecycle): Create a Finite State Machine (FSM) for a generic plant lifecycle.

States: SeedStorage -> Planted -> Germinating -> Vegetative -> Flowering -> Fruiting -> Harvested / Dead.

Transitions: Based on time_elapsed AND conditions_met (water/temp).

Task 2 (Companion Logic): Write a pure function calculateCompanionScore(targetPlant, nearbyPlants[]).

Input: A target plant type and an array of existing plant types in the Bed.

Logic: Return a score (-1 to +1) based on a hardcoded adjacency matrix of companion plants.

Task 3 (Calendar): Write a utility that accepts a User Location (Lat/Long) and a Plant Type, and returns a boolean isSowingSeason().

Use a simplified lookup table for Northern/Southern hemispheres initially.

Agent C: UI/UX & Component Designer
Goal: Build the Visual Language and React Components.

Prompt: You are the Frontend Lead. We are building a Mobile-First PWA in React + TailwindCSS.

Task: Design the Component Hierarchy for the "Garden Field" view.

Visual Metaphor: Users view a grid (Garden Bed). They open a "Hand" (Inventory) of cards at the bottom. They drag a card to a grid slot.

Deliverables:

CardComponent: Displays plant stats. Needs Expanded (Modal) and Collapsed (Thumbnail) states.

GridSlot: A droppable target. Visualizes soil state (Dry/Wet) and Plant Stage.

HUD: Navigation bar (Garden, Store, Library, Calendar).

Constraint: Use CSS Grid for the Garden Bed to handle responsive resizing. Ensure touch events work for Drag-and-Drop on mobile.

Agent D: content & Library Curator
Goal: Populate the static data (The Seeds).

Prompt: You are the Content Specialist.

Task: Generate a JSON dataset for the "Starter Pack" of seeds (Tomato, Basil, Carrot, Lettuce, Marigold).

Include accurate agronomic data:

germinationDays: (Min/Max)

waterFreq: (Days)

companions: (List of IDs)

antagonists: (List of IDs)

sowingMonths: (Array of months 0-11 for N. Hemisphere)

Format this strictly according to the schema provided by the Data Architect.

Phase 3: Self-Correction & Review Loops (The "Check" Protocol)
Before merging code from any agent, run this checklist:

The "Airplane Mode" Test: If I turn off Wi-Fi, does the PlantedEntity still update its state from "Germinating" to "Vegetative" after the time passes? (Logic must be local).

The "Thumb" Test: Can I drag a seed card from the inventory to the bed using only my thumb while holding the phone?

The "Reality" Test: Does the isSowingSeason function correctly block me from planting Tomatoes in December (assuming Northern Hemisphere)?
